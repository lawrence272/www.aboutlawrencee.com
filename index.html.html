    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I am an IT student at QCU University with a passion for technology and computer science. Through my coursework and hands-on experience, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for the dynamic and ever-evolving world of information technology.
    </p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>
      On this website, I aim to create a digital space where I can share my journey as an IT student at QCU University. Whether it's detailing my hands-on experiences with cutting-edge technologies, providing insights into the latest developments in the IT industry, or simply expressing my thoughts on the exciting world of computer science, I hope you find something valuable here.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      In my day-to-day life, I'm a dedicated IT student at QCU University, juggling my academic responsibilities with a part-time job on weekends. Despite not having a plethora of hobbies, I find joy in connecting with nature and spending quality time with my dogs and cat. Additionally, I have a penchant for dressing up, and when I'm not immersed in my studies or job, I indulge in the therapeutic art of baking. I'm not much of an outdoorsy person; I thoroughly enjoy the comfort of staying inside.
